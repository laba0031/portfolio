This is my online portfolio, all images used are my own or are open sourced icons. 
This portfolio includes some of my favourite pieces of work. I try to make images based off of emotions or the way I am feeling and bring that to life.
I try to take my work to the extreme and hopefully this portfolio gives you a look into what I can do.
Some challenges I found were creating a nice snap and a nice sizing but I found scroll reveal and clamp very very helpful tools.
This was my second time ever using javascript so it was very new to me and definintely a challenge. 
But I found some tutorials that were very helpful and many forums that had great advice. I cant' wait to learn it in the near future.

I used fonts such as Poppins and Playfair https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@400;600&family=Poppins:wght@300;400&display=swap
and icons from the following place https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/boxicons@latest/css/boxicons.min.css
scroll reveal from https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal@4.0.0/dist/scrollreveal.min.js
